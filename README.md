## This is a fork of [ZaneyOS](https://gitlab.com/Zaney/zaneyos) with all the changes I need. 

Sometimes I have features ZaneyOS doesn't have and sometimes it will probably have things I didn't include in my verison.

ZaneyOS is a simple way of reproducing my configuration on any NixOS system. This includes the wallpaper, scripts, applications, config files, and more.
